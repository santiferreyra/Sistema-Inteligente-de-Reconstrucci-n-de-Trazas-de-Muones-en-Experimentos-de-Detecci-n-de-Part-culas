During the execution of the CONNIE experiment, 14 sensors (charge-coupled devices) were deployed in the vicinity of the Angra dos Reis nuclear reactor, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The main objective is to measure neutrino interactions through recoils of atomic nuclei. Over the years, these sensors have recorded images of particles, with muons standing out as a significant component of the noise, originating from cosmic ray impacts in the atmosphere. The aim of this work was to develop an intelligent system for reconstructing muon trajectories through the sensors. To achieve this purpose, an algorithm calibrated using synthetic images generated by GEANT4 was employed, capable of predicting and determining muon trajectories based on the characteristics of impacts determined in the detectors. Additionally, a model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (YOLOv8) was implemented, trained to identify and classify muonic events
