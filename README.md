During the execution of the CONNIE experiment, 14 sensors
(charge-coupled devices) were deployed in the vicinity of the Angra dos Reis nuclear reactor, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The main objective is to measure neutrino interactions through recoils of atomic nuclei. Over the years, these sensors have recorded images
of particles, with muons standing out as a significant component of
the noise, originating from cosmic ray impacts in the atmosphere.
The aim of this work was to develop an intelligent system for reconstructing muon trajectories through the sensors. To achieve this
purpose, an algorithm calibrated using synthetic images generated
by GEANT4 was employed, capable of predicting and determining
muon trajectories based on the characteristics of impacts determined in the detectors. Additionally, a model based on Convolutional
Neural Networks (YOLOv8) was implemented, trained to identify
and classify muonic events
